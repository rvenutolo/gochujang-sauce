 * Reduced brown sugar to 8 oz.
 * Used full bottle of Mexian coke
 * Sweetness was pretty good, maybe use a bit less sugar (6 oz.?)

 * Used 8oz. toasted white sugar.
 * Probably can't taste the toasted sugar.
 * Sweetness right on.

 * Used 8oz. light brown sugar.
 * Used gochujang picked up from Buford Highway Farmers Market. Think it is same brand as previous Amazon purchases.
 * Initial tasting doesn't seem to have enough heat. Perhaps needs a touch less sugar. Or might have tasted it too often that I do not notice the heat. Maybe needs to be thicker to concentrate heat.
