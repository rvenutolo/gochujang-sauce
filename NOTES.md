 * Reduced brown sugar to 8 oz.
 * Used full bottle of Mexian coke.
 * Sweetness was pretty good, maybe use a bit less sugar (6 oz.?).

### 2016-05-23
 * Used 8oz. toasted white sugar.
 * Probably can't taste the toasted sugar.
 * Sweetness right on.
 
### 2016-05-28
 * Used 8oz. light brown sugar.
 * Used gochujang picked up from Buford Highway Farmers Market. Think it is same brand as previous Amazon purchases.
 * Initial tasting doesn't seem to have enough heat. Perhaps needs a touch less sugar. Or might have tasted it too often that I do not notice the heat. Maybe needs to be thicker to concentrate heat.

### 2016-06-03
 * Bryan suggested I try half/half white/brown.
 * Made two half batches; one with white sugar, one with light brown sugar.
 * Undecided which I like better.

### 2016-06-10
 * Used "extra spicy" gochujang.
 * Previous batches were better balanced.
 * Should try a batch with just toasted white sugar.
 
### 2016-06-18
 * Made double batch
 * Use half toasted white sugar, half dark brown sugar.
 * Used Sprite instead of ginger ale.

### 2016-07-03
 * [Made quarter batches, one each with](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvenutolo/gochujang-sauce/master/images/sugar_test.jpg):
  * white sugar
  * toasted white sugar
  * light brown sugar
  * dark brown sugar
 * Prefer toasted white sugar over non-toasted. Like caramel undertone.
 * Prefer dark brown sugar over light. More depth.
 * Prefer toasted white to dark brown. Like the upfront flavor.
 * Made three mixes:
  * half toasted white, half dark brown sugar
  * two-thirds toasted white, one-third dark brown sugar
  * one-third toasted white, two-thirds dark brown sugar
 * Liked first two more than third, but no strong preference.

### 2016-07-09
 * Made double batch with half toasted white sugar and half dark brown sugar.

 * Probably thickened sauce a touch too much, but still good.
